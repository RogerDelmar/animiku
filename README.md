AniMiku Renderer
Copyright (c) 2014 Justin Byers

AniMiku is a custom rendering engine and concert management system built on
DirectX 10. It allows anyone to utilize models, motion data and audio to easily
create live renders for holographic effect concerts, originally aimed at the
VOCALOID community. More info at http://animiku.com

AniMiku is licensed under the GNU GPL v3. See the LICENSING file for more information.

Built with DirectX 10 SDK (June 2010) and Qt 5.1.0. Projects in VS2013 format. Requires VS2013 Qt Add-in

Development on the AniMiku project was ended October 2014. The latest version of the engine (the same I used
at my NekoCon 15 and Tora-Con 2013 concerts) and the prototype improved UI built on Qt is now released open source
under the GPL v3.

AniMiku uses the Bullet Physics Library.
